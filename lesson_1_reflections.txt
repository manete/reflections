how did viewning a diff between two version of a file help you see the bug tha was introduced?

I think that it is easy to see differents between files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

He can see the diferent file versions.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros to manually are: 
	- Choose when save your commits.	
cons:
	- you can forget to commit your changes

Pros to automatically saved: 
	- you dont forget to commit your changes
cons:
	- you have a lot of saves and its difficult to follow your historial version.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because there are times you need to save files that are related. But there are other times that you only need to save a file is no longer leading relationship with another 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log to show commit in branch

git diff to show differtnt in files


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

yo can compare distinct changesets to show differences and see changes.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git.
